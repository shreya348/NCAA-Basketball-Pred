**üèÄ** NCAA Basketball Tournament Prediction Using Deep Sequence Models**
**Project Overview**
Predicting the outcomes of NCAA Basketball Tournaments has traditionally relied on subjective opinions or simple statistics. In this project, we leverage deep learning techniques to forecast tournament outcomes by modeling the sequential dynamics and relational structures found in historical game data.

We implemented and compared three models:

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks

Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) models

Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN)

The models were trained and evaluated on a richly engineered dataset spanning from 1985 to 2025, incorporating team statistics, player metrics, seeding info, and game venue characteristics.




‚ú® **Key Features**
Implementation of three deep learning models: LSTM, BiLSTM, and TCN.

Feature engineering incorporating team performance metrics, player stats, seeding information, and venue characteristics.

Dual-optimizer training experiments (SGD and Adam) for assessing model convergence and performance.

Comprehensive evaluation using accuracy, Brier score, and AUC-ROC metrics.

In-depth analysis of model performance, highlighting the superiority of BiLSTM for capturing complex temporal dependencies.

Insights into model generalization for broader sports analytics applications (e.g., football, baseball).


üìà Dataset
Historical NCAA Division I Tournament Data (Men's and Women's)

Features include:

Team performance metrics (e.g., win margins, possession efficiency)

Player statistics

Team rankings and seedings

Game venue information

Extensive feature engineering was performed to create rich input representations.

üìö **Technologies Used**
-Python 3.9+

-TensorFlow / PyTorch

-NumPy, Pandas

-Scikit-learn

-Matplotlib, Seaborn

-Google Colab

üèÜ Conclusion
This study demonstrates the effectiveness of deep sequential models in sports prediction tasks.
Key takeaways:

BiLSTM models are highly effective for datasets with relational but weak chronological structure.

LSTM models perform well but may miss out on some contextual information.

TCNs may require longer, well-ordered sequences to perform effectively.

By moving beyond static statistics and traditional machine learning models, deep learning can bring greater objectivity, reproducibility, and insight to sports analytics.
